## Image Specifications

- Recommended resolution: around 800x600px
- Should showcase active channels, member count, and community engagement

## Where to Find Appropriate Images

### For hero-bg.jpg:
1. Stock photo websites:
   - Shutterstock: Search for "forex trading background" or "trading chart dark"
   - Adobe Stock: Search for "trading charts blue" or "financial data visualization"
   - Unsplash: Search for "trading chart" (free option)
   - Pexels: Search for "stock market" (free option)

2. Create your own:
   - Take a screenshot of MetaTrader 5 showing multiple charts with a dark theme
   - Apply a dark blue overlay/filter to enhance the visual appeal
   - Blur slightly to ensure text readability when placed on top

### For discord-mockup.png:
1. Take a screenshot of your AxisAlgo Discord server
2. Make sure to:
   - Capture active channels and member count
   - Blur out any personal information or usernames if needed
   - Show the server name and channel structure
   - Capture some example conversations if possible

## Important Notes

1. Please ensure you have the rights to use any images you select. If using stock photos, purchase the appropriate license.
2. Free alternatives like Unsplash and Pexels offer high-quality images that can be used commercially without attribution.
3. For the best visual appearance, maintain the recommended aspect ratios and resolutions.
4. The hero background will have a dark overlay applied to it via CSS, so lighter images can still work.
